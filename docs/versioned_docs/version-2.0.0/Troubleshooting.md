## Is the plugin loaded?
Does the plugin show up in `/pl` and is it green?
If it’s not there, you might not have installed the plugin correctly or haven’t restarted the server yet.

## Is the config correct?
Make sure that your config is correct, and that the enabled field on your rules is set to true!

## Check your logs!
Check your console for errors, especially on server start and when a player dies. If there are any errors, they might give you a clue as to what is going wrong.
You should also skim trough the `latest.log` file located in the `logs` folder of your server for any errors related to BetterKeepInventory.
