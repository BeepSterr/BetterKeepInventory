# Grace

Dying constantly is not fun, Especially not if you keep losing durability and more from it.

That’s why you can now configure Grace! Set the config value `main > grace` to a 30 and players will not be affected by BetterKeepInventory for 30 seconds after dying!

```yaml
main:
  grace: 30
```

*(You can set it to 0 to disable it)*

# Essentials Integration

BetterKeepInventory will now apply its rules when using `essentials.keepinv` permission.

# Overrides

Overrides is a new system that allows you to disable the plugins effects based on certain conditions:

## Override: Damage Type

You can now filter based on damage type. Want to not lose durability from PvP? You can!
Want players to not keep their hunger when starving? You can!

```yaml
overrides:
  worlds:
    world: # The default world
      damage_types: # Damage type of death 
        FALL: # When player dies of falling, Any of these are supported https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/event/entity/EntityDamageEvent.DamageCause.html
          - HOTBAR
    world_no_pvp:
      damage_types:
        PVP: # A Custom "PVP" damage type also exists.
        - ITEMS
    world_disabled:
    - ALL # Disable everything in world_disabled
    world_no_exp_loss:
    - EXP
    - EXP_LEVEL  # Disable exp loss in world_no_exp_loss
```

## Override: Towny

BetterKeepInventory now integrates with Towny! You can enable specific overrides for any town, nation, or wilderness

```yaml
overrides:
	# ...
  towny:
    enabled: true

		# Towny Towns
		towns:
		  wilderness: # Any unclaimed land
		  - NONE
		  any_town: # Any claimed land, Does not matter who it belongs to
		  - ECO
		  player_town: # Town the player is a resident/mayor of.
		  - ECO
		  specific_town_name: # A Town called "specific_town_name"
		  - ECO
		  'North Appletown': # A Town called "North Appletown"
		  - ITEMS
		  - HUNGER

		# Towny Nations
		nations:
      any_nation: # any town that belongs to any nation
        - NONE
      player_nation: # any town that belongs to the same nation as their town
        - ALL
      specific_nation_name: # specific nation called "specific_nation_name"
        - ECO
      'The Empire': # specific nation called "The Empire"
        - ITEMS
        - HUNGER
```

# Bug Fixes:

- Sometimes reloading did not properly reload exp config
