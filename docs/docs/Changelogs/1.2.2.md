# 1.2.2

**Whats New:**

Relatively small update this time, you can now set the max hunger someone respawns with. This update has no changes to permissions.

keep_hunger_level_max will cap the hunger of the player on respawn, this means you can make it so players will NEVER respawn with full hunger, but what they already had clamped between keep_hunger_level_min and keep_hunger_level_max. set both to the same value to force a certain hunger level on respawn

## **Permission Changes:**

```jsx
none
```

## Config Changes

```jsx
keep_hunger_level_max: 10
```
