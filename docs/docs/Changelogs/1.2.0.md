# 1.2

**Whats New:**

Added EXP & Hunger level settings! You can now make users not reset hunger on death! You can choose to make players lose levels or just the progress on the current one

## **Permission Changes:**

```jsx
+ betterkeepinventory.bypass.xp
+ betterkeepinventory.bypass.xp.level
+ betterkeepinventory.bypass.hunger
* betterkeepinventory.bypass.all
  all now also has the xp, xp.level & hunger bypass nodes
```

## Config Changes

```jsx
+ enable_xp_loss
+ min_xp_loss_pct
+ max_xp_loss_pct
+ xp_reset_current_level_progress
+ enable_item_damage
  Initially set to whatever "enabled" is set to, 
	this will now toggle items taking durability damage 
	(enable option itself now acts as a way to quickly turn the entire plugin off)
+ keep_hunger_level
+ keep_hunger_level_min
```
